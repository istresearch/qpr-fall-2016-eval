# Domain Discovery Post Hoc

### Obtaining DD `_id`s
The script `dd_ids.py` iterates over all the various teams submissions and generates sets of `_id`s for each DD index:

Each set of `_id`s is then written out as a line separated plain text file per DD team:

* NYU: `nyu_dd_ids.txt`
* Hyperion Gray: `hg_dd_ids.txt`
* JPL: `jpl_dd_ids.txt`
